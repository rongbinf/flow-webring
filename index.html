<h1>Flow.</h1>
<p>This is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring>webring</a> working as a bookmark to collect people's flows. It can be about how you manage your knowledge (this is actually the inital purpose), brew coffee, write codes, spend an ordinary Sunday afternoon, research, create, and many more. It is about <strong>you</strong> and <strong>your way of life</strong>.<br>
If you have a webpage about your flow, <a href="{{'/join'|relative_url}}">join this webring</a>

<p>If the ring is broken, please <a href={{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/new>submit an error report on GitHub</a>.
